abstract = {Paleotemperature proxy data form the cornerstone of paleoclimate research and are integral to understanding the evolution of the Earth system across the Phanerozoic Eon. Here, we present PhanSST, a database containing over 150,000 data points from five proxy systems that can be used to estimate past sea surface temperature. The geochemical data have a near-global spatial distribution and temporally span most of the Phanerozoic. Each proxy value is associated with consistent and queryable metadata fields, including information about the location, age, and taxonomy of the organism from which the data derive. To promote transparency and reproducibility, we include all available published data, regardless of interpreted preservation state or vital effects. However, we also provide expert-assigned diagenetic assessments, ecological and environmental flags, and other proxy-specific fields, which facilitate informed and responsible reuse of the database. The data are quality control checked and the foraminiferal taxonomy has been updated. PhanSST will serve as a valuable resource to the paleoclimate community and has myriad applications, including evolutionary, geochemical, diagenetic, and proxy calibration studies.},

abstract = {Archaeal membrane lipids are widely used for paleotemperature reconstructions, yet these molecular fossils also bear rich information about ecology and evolution of marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Here we identified thermal and nonthermal behaviors of archaeal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) by comparing the GDGT-based temperature index (TEX86) to the ratio of GDGTs with two and three cyclopentane rings (GDGT-2/GDGT-3). Thermal-dependent biosynthesis should increase TEX86 and decrease GDGT-2/GDGT-3 when the ambient temperature increases. This presumed temperature-dependent (PTD) trend is observed in GDGTs derived from cultures of thermophilic and mesophilic AOA. The distribution of GDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments collected from above the pycnocline?shallow water samples?also follows the PTD trend. These similar GDGT distributions between AOA cultures and shallow water environmental samples reflect shallow ecotypes of marine AOA. While there are currently no cultures of deep AOA clades, GDGTs derived from deep water SPM and marine sediment samples exhibit nonthermal behavior deviating from the PTD trend. The presence of deep AOA increases the GDGT-2/GDGT-3 ratio and distorts the temperature-controlled correlation between GDGT-2/GDGT-3 and TEX86. We then used Gaussian mixture models to statistically characterize these diagnostic patterns of modern AOA ecology from paleo-GDGT records to infer the evolution of marine AOA from the Mid-Mesozoic to the present. Long-term GDGT-2/GDGT-3 trends suggest a suppression of today?s deep water marine AOA during the Mesozoic?early Cenozoic greenhouse climates. Our analysis provides invaluable insights into the evolutionary timeline and the expansion of AOA niches associated with major oceanographic and climate changes.},

abstract = {<p>Potential sources of mercury in producing oil and gas fields can be from either geogenic (hydrothermal fluid migration, coals and carbonaceous shales, etc.) or anthropogenic (water re-injection activities) sources. Due to lack of knowledge on mercury occurrence in the petroleum systems in SE Asia, no conclusive explanation has yet been made for the variable, sometimes elevated mercury concentrations measured production fluids in wells in the Pailin area, southern Pattani Basin, offshore Thailand. In prior work, petroleum engineers attempted to identify likely Hg contributing zones by conducting detailed investiga-tions using dedicated platforms with known perforated pay zones based on geological marker correlation. But none of engineering work considered the possibility of documentation of  geological controls. This current research project is the first attempt to integrate conventional geological approaches (cuttings, petrography, isotopes, wireline and seismic) with engineering datasets (mercury surveillance data, gas composition, production data) in order to better interpret and evaluate potential sources of mercury in the Pailin operating area. Based on the series of geological evaluations applied in this integration, the following conclusions are drawn as to the origin of the anomalous Hg levels; (1) There is a poor correlation between levels of Hg and deeply-sourced CO2 making a basement source less likely, (2) There is no obvious indication of hydrothermal fluid influence, based on the C-O isotopic signatures of various carbonate cements, specifically sampled from cuttings, (3) The low levels of reinjec-tion of produced water and a lack of correlation to this parameter across the area, means an anthropogenic cause for mercury-enriched hydrocarbons is unlikely, and (4) Intrabasinal geogenic sources, particularly from mature marginal marine coals and carbonaceous shales characterized by elevated levels of uranium, as indicated in spectral gamma ray log (“High Gamma Zones”), are considered the most likely source of elevated Hg Levels. Mature generating zones of this interval are most common in Upper Sequence 2 in the Gulf of Thailand (GOT) stratigraphy.This study concludes that mercury and its compounds were either sequestered in the remains of coalforming land plants or deposited in associated muddy marine-influenced swamp and transitional marine deposits, where organic matter accumulated in reducing environments. Then, as these rocks were buried and matured the mercury co-migrated with the expelled hydrocarbon from its source to its reservoirs.</p>},
